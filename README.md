## Purpose

The Eccentric Circles program aims to improve visual tracking, coordination, and focus through interactive manipulation of eccentric circles on a canvas. By engaging with the eccentric circles exercise, users can potentially enhance their visual tracking abilities and eye-hand coordination skills.

## Keybindings and Mouse Control

The Eccentric Circles program supports the following keybindings and mouse control:

| Key        | Action                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| D          | Increase the gap between the circle groups   |
| A          | Decrease the gap between the circle groups   |
| W          | Increase the stroke width of the circles     |
| S          | Decrease the stroke width of the circles     |
| Left       | Move the circle groups to the left           |
| Right      | Move the circle groups to the right          |
| Up         | Move the circle groups upwards               |
| Down       | Move the circle groups downwards             |
| Escape     | End the dragging action                      |

Additionally, the program allows dragging of the circle groups using the mouse. Clicking and dragging on the canvas will move the groups accordingly. When dragging, the cursor will be hidden to provide a smoother experience.

Please note that these controls are provided as part of the prototype and may vary in a full-fledged implementation or with different configurations.
